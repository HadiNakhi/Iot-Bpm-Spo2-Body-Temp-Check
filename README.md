# Iot-Bpm-Spo2-Body-Temp-Check
With tons of new healthcare technology start-ups, IoT is rapidly revolutionizing the healthcare industry. In this project, we have designed the IoT Based Patient Health Monitoring System using ESP8266 & Arduino. The IoT platform used in this project is ThingSpeak. ThingSpeak is an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) application and API to store and retrieve data from things using the HTTP protocol over the Internet or via a Local Area Network. This IoT device could read the pulse rate and measure the surrounding temperature. It continuously monitors the pulse rate and surrounding temperature and updates them to an IoT platform.
In this project:

   Arduino Wemos D1, puls-oximeter sensor and Temperature Sensor
   Node-red as the main server
   MQTT and HTTP protocols
   Mysql Database
   Graphical interface (WebPage) using HTML, CSS
   Use ThingSpeak Tools For Draw Charts
   Long Polling method in WebPage (Long polling is a method that server applications use to hold a client connection until information becomes available)

used.
